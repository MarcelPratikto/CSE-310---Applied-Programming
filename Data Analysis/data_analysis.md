## Elevator Pitch
This data analysis project will analyze the following dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cedricaubin/ai-ml-salaries
I'm doing this because I'm interested in pursuing a career in AI/Machine Learning.

### GRAND QUESTION 1
#### Salary by position
The table, which only shows the top 5 salaries, tells us that the highest salary job is Principal Data Engineer at \$600,000.
When using a scatter plot to get a better overview of the data, however, we see that on average the highest paying job is not Principal Data Engineer.
The second table shows that the job with the highest average salary is Data Analytics Lead at \$405,000.
